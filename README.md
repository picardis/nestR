# nestR

## Overview

The nestR package includes functions to (1) identify nesting locations along bird movement trajectories obtained from GPS tracking data and (2) estimate the outcome of nesting attempts based on patterns of nest revisitation. The package includes functions to run the analysis as well as interactive exploratory tools and data processing and custom plotting functions. The package comes with three example datasets, each containing GPS trajectories for 2 individual-years of the following species: wood storks (*Mycteria americana*), lesser kestrel (*Falco naumanni*), and Mediterranean gull (*Ichthyaetus melanocephalus*). 

## Installation Instructions

## Resources

Functions in nestR implement an approach first described in our manuscript, "Analysis of movement recursions to detect reproductive events and estimate their fate in central place foragers" (Picardi et al. 2020).
